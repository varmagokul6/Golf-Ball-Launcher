# Golf Ball Launcher

This was a project that I undertook as part of my curriculum at the University of California, Irvine. The proejct revolved around designing and developing a golf ball launcher capable of launching a golf ball into a bucket at a specific distance away. As part of a six-person team, we worked together to follow the engineering design process and ensure the design we had was the best possible scenario for our given situation. For this project, I was the programming lead, taking on the challenge of designing the dynamic model for the launcher as well as designing some of the major components for the project. 

## Objective
The objective of the project was to design a golf ball launcher that could launch a golf ball directly into a bucket given a random platform height and bucket distance, as well as launching the golf ball with at least one bounce into the bucket. 

## Requirements
<li>
  System must be able to determine optimal launch angle and change launch angle based on given input distance
</li>
<li>
  System must be able to launch the golf ball directly into the bucket
</li>
<li>
  System must be able to launch the golf ball into the bucket with at least one bounce
</li>
<li>
  System must be able to measure the exit velocity of the golf ball
</li>
<li>
  Must conform to budget ($110 for parts, $65 for manufacturing)
</li>
